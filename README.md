# a quick and dirty tool i made for binary <-> decimal conversions

for binary -> decimal: prefix binary number with 'b' (i.e. b0100 -> d4)

for decimal -> binary: prefix binary number with 'd' (i.e. d5 -> b0101)

supports binary math: prefix expression with 'b', don't use spaces (i.e. b1111+1001 -> b11000)

to exit: 'e'
